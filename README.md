## üö® Safety Features

### Smart Ring Integration (Simulated)
```javascript
// Ring status monitoring
const ringStatus = {
  connected: true,
  battery: 85,
  lastSync: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  location: { lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060 }
}

// SOS activation
ring.onSOSPress(() => {
  sendEmergencyAlert({
    location: ring.getLocation(),
    timestamp: new Date(),
    type: 'ring_sos'
  });
});
```

### GPS Tracking with Polylines
- Real-time location updates every 5 seconds
- Route history with polyline visualization
- Geofencing for safe/unsafe area detection
- Location accuracy monitoring

### AI-Powered Analytics (Simulated)
```javascript
// Mock CCTV detection events
const detectionTypes = {
  'lone_woman_night': { confidence: 0.89, risk: 'high' },
  'surrounded_woman': { confidence: 0.92, risk: 'critical' },
  'sos_gesture': { confidence: 0.76, risk: 'high' }
}
```

## üîß Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Modern web browser with geolocation support

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/women-safety-analytics.git
cd women-safety-analytics

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Setup
The application uses simulated data for demonstration purposes. No external APIs or keys are required for the basic functionality.

## üìä Mock Data Configuration

### Location History
Edit `src/lib/mockData.ts` to customize location points:
```javascript
export const mockLocationHistory = [
  { lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060, timestamp: new Date(), address: "Manhattan, NY" },
  // Add more locations...
];
```

### CCTV Analytics
Modify detection confidence and types:
```javascript
export const mockCCTVDetections = [
  {
    detectionType: 'lone_woman_night',
    confidence: 0.89,
    location: 'Downtown Plaza'
  }
];
```

### Alert Hotspots
Update risk areas and alert frequencies:
```javascript
export const hotspotData = [
  { area: 'Downtown', alerts: 25, riskLevel: 'High' },
  // Add more hotspots...
];
```

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest
- User locations stored with minimal retention
- Guardian access links expire after 24 hours
- No persistent tracking without explicit consent

### Privacy Controls
- Users can pause tracking at any time
- Location history can be cleared on demand
- Guardian access can be revoked instantly
- All data is anonymized in analytics

## üöÄ Deployment

### Build for Production
```bash
# Create optimized build
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Code splitting for faster initial loads
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Service worker for offline functionality
- CDN deployment for global availability

## üß™ Testing & Simulation

### Simulated Features
1. **Ring Connection**: Randomly toggles online/offline status
2. **GPS Updates**: Simulates movement with realistic coordinates
3. **Battery Drain**: Gradually decreases over time
4. **CCTV Detections**: Generates random AI detection events
5. **Alert Responses**: Simulates emergency service response times

### Test Scenarios
```bash
# Test SOS activation
POST /api/alerts/sos
{
  "userId": "user_001",
  "location": { "lat": 40.7128, "lng": -74.0060 },
  "type": "manual_sos"
}

# Test guardian notification
GET /guardian/001
# Should display real-time alert with map
```
